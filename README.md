üß† A collection of my computer science and software development projects  documenting my journey from student to software engineer üå±

---

## üéØ Purpose  
This repository serves as my personal **development lab** ‚Äî a space to prototype ideas, test concepts, and sharpen my engineering discipline through consistent hands-on practice.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Structure  
Each folder contains a focused project or exercise exploring specific programming principles, algorithms, or system concepts.

---

## üß∞ Tech Stack  
Currently centered around **C**, with gradual expansion into **Python**, **web technologies**, and **systems programming**.

---

## üöÄ Goals  
- Maintain a disciplined coding routine  
- Develop deep understanding of computer science fundamentals  
- Build a strong foundation for advanced software engineering  

---

## üßæ Notes  
Some projects are intentionally experimental or incomplete ‚Äî each one represents an iteration in the learning and mastery process.

---

### üß† Growth Mindset  
> ‚ÄúEvery line of code brings me closer to mastery.‚Äù
